description: Configuring NIXL's logging -- verbosity, per-process log files, filename templates, size limits, and failure behavior.

## Overview

NIXL logs to standard error by default. `NIXL_LOG_LEVEL` controls which records are emitted, and `NIXL_LOG_FILE` additionally mirrors them into a file without changing stderr output.

Logging settings are read during library initialization and must be set before the process starts.

## Verbosity

`NIXL_LOG_LEVEL` accepts `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` or `TRACE`, defaulting to `WARN`. The log level applies to both stderr and, when it is enabled, the log file.

## Writing to a file

Set `NIXL_LOG_FILE` to a path:

```bash
export NIXL_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
export NIXL_LOG_FILE=/var/log/nixl/agent.log
```

The file is opened in append mode, and each record is written immediately.

<Note>
Leaving `NIXL_LOG_FILE` unset, or setting it to an empty value, disables file logging.
</Note>

## One file per process

Each process should write to a distinct file. Sharing a path may interleave records and makes rotation unsafe. Use these escapes to generate per-process paths:

| Escape | Expands to |
|--------|------------|
| `%h` | Host name |
| `%p` | Process id |
| `%t` | Process startup time in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch. |
| `%%` | A literal `%` |

Unknown escapes and a trailing `%` are rejected. Use `%%` for a literal percent.

```bash
export NIXL_LOG_FILE=/var/log/nixl/run_%h_%p_%t.log
```

Use `%t` to distinguish restarts because process ids may be reused. `%t` uses nanosecond resolution.

### Retention

Paths containing `%p` and `%t` create a file for every process and run. Manage retention by:

- Deleting each run's log directory when it is no longer needed.
- Omitting `%t` and setting `NIXL_LOG_FILE_SIZE`, at the cost of a restarted process potentially continuing an earlier file.

## Bounding the size

Without a limit the log file grows indefinitely. `NIXL_LOG_FILE_SIZE` caps it at 16 KiB or greater, in bytes, optionally suffixed with `K`, `M` or `G`. The floor is 16 KiB so a typical fatal stack trace fits in the file:

```bash
export NIXL_LOG_FILE=/var/log/nixl/agent.log
export NIXL_LOG_FILE_SIZE=64M
```

On reaching the limit, the file is renamed with a `.1` suffix, replacing the previous generation, and a new file is started. Files created under the limit occupy at most twice the configured size in total.

Existing files are not truncated when a limit is enabled or reduced. An oversized active file or `.1` backup can exceed the total bound until subsequent rotations replace it. Use a previously unused path if the bound must hold immediately.

A record larger than the entire limit cannot fit in either generation. It is still written to stderr, but is omitted from the log file. The first such omission is reported once on stderr; later records that fit continue to be written.

Without `NIXL_LOG_FILE_SIZE`, manage file growth externally or give each run a fresh path.

## When logging itself fails

File logging failures do not terminate the process by default:

| Failure | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| The file cannot be opened | Reported at error severity; file logging is disabled. |
| A later write fails | Reported once on stderr; further file records are dropped. |
| A rotation cannot be done | Reported on stderr; file logging stops. |
| A record is larger than the limit | Reported once on stderr; that record is omitted. Later records that fit are still written. |
| `NIXL_LOG_FILE_SIZE` is below 16 KiB or cannot be parsed | Reported at error severity; file logging is disabled. |

Set `NIXL_LOG_FILE_ERROR_IS_FATAL` to make a setup failure fatal instead: if the log file cannot be initialized -- an unopenable path or an invalid setting -- the process terminates with the report rather than running without its log. Failures after setup, such as a failed write or rotation, remain non-fatal.
